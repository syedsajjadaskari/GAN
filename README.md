# GAN

## Data Flow

Time to create our Generative Adversarial Network. A GAN has two components:

* Discriminator: Differentiate between real & fake images (Data)
* Generator: Creates fake images to fool the Discriminator

  
## Let’s look at the architecture of GAN

GAN Architecture
**Project Description: Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using TensorFlow**

**Overview**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of machine learning model that can be used to generate realistic data, such as images, text, and audio. GANs work by pitting two neural networks against each other: a generator and a discriminator. The generator tries to generate fake data that looks like real data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data.

This project will involve implementing a GAN using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework. We will train the GAN on a dataset of real images, and then use it to generate new images.

**Objectives**

The objectives of this project are to:

* Implement a GAN using TensorFlow.
* Train the GAN on a dataset of real images.
* Use the GAN to generate new images.
* Evaluate the performance of the GAN.

**Methodology**

To implement a GAN, we will first need to define the generator and discriminator networks. The generator network will take as input a random noise vector and output a fake image. The discriminator network will take as input an image and output a probability that the image is real.

Once we have defined the generator and discriminator networks, we will need to train them. To do this, we will use a technique called adversarial training. Adversarial training involves training the two networks simultaneously, where each network tries to improve its performance while making the other network's performance worse.

Once the GAN has been trained, we can use it to generate new images. To do this, we will simply sample a random noise vector and feed it to the generator network. The generator network will then output a fake image.

To evaluate the performance of the GAN, we will use a variety of metrics, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and the Inception Score. These metrics measure how realistic the generated images are.


The following resources will be used for this project:

* TensorFlow
* Python
* A dataset of real images

**Conclusion**

This project will provide an opportunity to learn about and implement GANs using TensorFlow. GANs are a powerful type of machine learning model that can be used to generate realistic data. This project will also provide an opportunity to learn about adversarial training and how it can be used to train GANs.

**Additional Notes**

This project can be customized to fit the interests and skills of the student. For example, the student could choose to train the GAN on a different type of data, such as text or audio. The student could also choose to experiment with different GAN architectures or training algorithms.
